hypocrite of 2015\nOnce I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean\nBeen feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses\nYou never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it\nI'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon\nHeritage of a small village, pardon my residence\nCame from the bottom of mankind\nMy hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide\nYou hate me don't you?\nYou hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture\nYou're fuckin' evil\nI want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey\nYou vandalize my perception but can't take style from me\nAnd this is more than confession\nI mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion\nI'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it\nYou sabotage my community, makin' a killin'\nYou made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga\n\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot\n\nI said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black\nWoi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black\nAnd man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we

black\nRemember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat\n\nI'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015\nOnce I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean\nI mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society\nThat's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me\nCurse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing\nThat I'ma be just another slave in my head\nInstitutionalized manipulation and lies\nReciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes\nYou hate me don't you?\nI know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself\nJealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt\nWatchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out\nMuscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah\nBlack and successful, this black man meant to be special\nKatzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?\nHow can I tell you I'm making a killin'?\nYou made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga\n\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the

celebrate February like it's my B-Day\nOr eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays\nOr jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements\nOr watch BET 'cause urban support is important\nSo

tomorrow\nI'm hopin' that I can borrow\nA peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important\nMy mind is really distorted\nI find nothing but trouble in my life\nI'm fortunate you believe in a dream\nThis orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine\nAnd last night was just another distraction\nOr a reaction of what we consider madness\nI know exactly what happened\nYou ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help\nHeld him like a newborn baby and made him feel\nLike everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up\nBut the type of bullet that stuck\nHad went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands\nMy plan's rather vindictive\nEverybody's a victim in my eyes\nWhen I ride it's a murderous rhythm\nAnd outside became pitch black\nA demon glued to my back, whispering \"Get 'em!\"\nI got 'em and I ain't give a fuck\nThat same mentality I told my brother not to duck\nIn actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors\nI wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover\nThe life that I knew as a youngin\nIn pajamas and dun-ta-duns\nWhen thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb\nNiggas like me never prosper\nPrognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted\nThis Piru shit been in me forever\nSo forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever\nAnd I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did\nJust promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big\nAnd if I die before your album drop, I hope\u2014 \n\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nYou wrote a song about my sister on your tape\nAnd called it Section.80\nThe message resembled \"Brenda's Got a Baby\"\nWhat's crazy was I was hearin' about it\nBut doubted your ignorance\nHow could you ever just put her on blast and shit?\nJudgin' her past and shit?\nWell, it's completely my future\nHer nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit\nAnd I'ma need that forty dollars\nEven if I got to fuck, suck and swallow\nIn the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed\nBy a married man, and father of three\nMy titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys\nMatter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's\nHe got a cousin named David and I seen him last week\nThis is the life of another girl damaged by the system\nThese foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em\nSee, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em\nBack to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim\nOf a family gene that show women how to be woman\nOr better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'\nThen you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught\nThree niggas in one room, first time I was tossed\nAnd I'm exhausted, but fuck that \"Sorry for your loss\" shit\nMy sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain\nIf you can't fit the pumps I walk in?\nI'll wait\u2026 Your rebuttal a little too late\nAnd if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song\n'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own\nAnd matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?\nA doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight\nI'll probably live longer than you and never fade away\nI'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate\nAnd I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'\nI'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'\nYou lyin' to these motherfuckers\nTalkin' about you can help 'em with my story\nYou can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga\nDon't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...\n\nWhen the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nSometimes I look in the mirror\nAnd ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?\nIf it's today, I hope I hear a\nCry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon\nWith the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus\nI wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'\nThe scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance\nWith the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed\nMay the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons\nI suffer a lot\nAnd every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch\nI tie my stomach in knots\nAnd I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death\nMy imagination is surely an aggravation of threats\nThat can come about, \u2019cause the tongue is mighty powerful\nAnd I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch\nMaybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death\nReally stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest\nAnd you're right, your brother was a brother to me\nAnd your sister's situation was the one that pulled me\nIn a direction to speak on somethin'\nThat's realer than the TV screen\nBy any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between\nHer personal life, I was like \"It need to be told\"\nCursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul\nExactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'\nOr steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's\nI count lives, all on these songs\nLook at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong\nFightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong\nAnd hope that at

King saw the king in me, so why can't you?\nIn order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too\n(That wasn't no sample, nigga!)\nMuddy water flow, Dixie rebel past\nFuck your Louis flag, poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass (on your wifey's ass)\nThat's out of line, but in livin' color?\nI'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artist",

Somebody that's holdin' my checks\nJust to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?\nI read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered\nHow did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?\nThe type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'\nDrill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'\nI practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck\nAt 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged\nHow they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city\nWhat they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me\nWhat they see from me would trickle down generations in time\nWhat they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines\n\nI'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity\nI'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me\nI'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride\n'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness\nFear, whatever it is, both is distinctive\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nSearchin' for resolutions until somebody get back\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nWonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap\nDamn\n\nGod damn you, God damn me\nGod damn us, God damn we\nGod damn us all\n\nVerse 2 says, \"You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities\"\nSo until we come back to these commandments\nUntil you come back to these commandments\nWe gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse\nBecause He said He's gonna punish us\nThe so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians\nAre the true children of Israel\nWe are the Israelites, according to the Bible\nThe children of Israel\nHe's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience\nBecause we chose to follow other gods\nThat man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee\nSo, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you\nBecause He loves you, so that's why we get chastised\nThat's why we're in the position that we're in\nUntil we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments\nAnd do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us\nWe gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live\nHere, in today, in the United States of America\nI love you, family, and I pray for you\nGod bless you\nShalom",

full of resentment\nResentment that turned into a deep depression\nFound myself screaming in the hotel room\nI didn\u2019t wanna self destruct\nThe evils of Lucy was all around me\nSo I went running for answers\nUntil I came home\nBut that didn\u2019t stop survivor\u2019s guilt\nGoing back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned\nOr maybe how A-1 my foundation was\nBut while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city\nI was entering a new one\nA war that was based on apartheid and discrimination\nMade me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned\nThe word was respect\nJust because you wore a different gang color than mine's\nDoesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t respect you as a black man\nForgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets\nIf I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us\nBut I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m no mortal man\nMaybe I\u2019m just another nigga\u201d\nShit and that\u2019s all I wrote\nI was gonna call it \"Another Nigga\" but, it ain\u2019t really a poem\nI just felt like it\u2019s something you probably could relate to\nOther than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you\nI always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-\nAbout a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground\nWhat you mean by that, what the ground represent?\nThe ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil\nRight\nThat\u2019s how I see it, my word is bond\nI see\u2014and the ground is the symbol for the poor people\nRight\nThe poor people is gonna open up this whole world\nAnd swallow up the rich people\n'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat\nAnd they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I\u2019m saying Wealthy, appetizing\nThe poor gonna be so poor, and hungry\nRight\nYou know what I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s gonna be like\nYou know what I'm saying, it's gonna be...\nThere might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-\nThey might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying?\nAight so let me ask you this then\nDo you see yourself as somebody that\u2019s rich\nOr somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?\nI see myself as a natural born hustler\nA true hustler in every sense of the word\nI took nothin\u2019, I took the opportunities\nI worked at the most menial and degrading job\nAnd built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it\nI went from having somebody managing me\nTo me hiring the person that works my management company\nI changed everything, I realized my destiny\nIn a matter of five years, you know what I\u2019m saying?\nI made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people\nNow it\u2019s time to make millions for myself, you know what I\u2019m saying?\nI made millions for the record companies\nI made millions for these movie companies\nNow I make millions for, for us\nAnd through your different avenues of success\nHow would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?\nBy my faith in God, by my faith in the game\nAnd by my faith in \"all good things come to those that stay true\"\nRight\nYou know what I\u2019m saying?\nAnd it was happening to me for a reason\nYou know what I\u2019m saying, I was noticing, shit\nI was punching the right buttons and it was happening\nSo it\u2019s no problem, you know\nI mean, it\u2019s a problem but I\u2019m not finna let them know\nI\u2019m finna go straight through\nWould you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that\nSomebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?\nShit, I like to think that at every opportunity I\u2019ve ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it\u2019s been met with resistance\nAnd not only me but, it goes down my family tree\nYou know what I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s in my veins to fight back\nAight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like\n\"We fighting a war, I\u2019m fighting a war I can\u2019t win\nAnd I wanna lay it all down\"\nIn this country, a black man only have like\n5 years we can exhibit maximum strength\nAnd that\u2019s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong\nWhile you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back\n'Cause once you turn 30 it\u2019s like\nThey take the heart and soul out of a man\nOut of a black man, in this country\nAnd you don\u2019t wanna fight no more\nAnd if you don\u2019t believe me, you can look around\nYou don\u2019t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers\nThat\u2019s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings\nOf the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that\nThere\u2019s nothing but turmoil goin\u2019 on so, I wanted to ask you\nWhat you think is the future for me and my generation today?\nI think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores\nAnd next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed\nFor real, I don\u2019t think America know that\nI think America think we was just playing\nAnd it\u2019s gonna be some more playing but\nIt ain\u2019t gonna be no playing\nIt\u2019s gonna be murder, you know what I\u2019m saying?\nIt\u2019s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker\nYou know what I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s gonna happen\nThat\u2019s crazy, man, in my opinion\nOnly hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations\nLot a people don\u2019t understand how important it is, you know\nSometimes I can like, get behind a mic\nAnd I don\u2019t know what type of energy I\u2019ma push out\nOr where it comes from, trip me out sometimes\nBecause it's spirits, we ain\u2019t even really rappin\u2019\nWe just letting our dead homies tell stories for us\nDamn\nI wanted to read one last thing to you\nIt\u2019s actually something a good friend had wrote\nDescribing my world, it says:\n\u201cThe caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it\nIts only job is to eat or consume everything around it\nIn order to protect itself from this mad city\nWhile consuming its environment\nThe caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive\nOne thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him\nBut praises the butterfly\nThe butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness\nAnd the beauty within the caterpillar\nBut having a harsh outlook on life\nThe caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak\nAnd figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits\nAlready surrounded by this mad city\nThe caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon\nWhich institutionalizes him\nHe can no longer see past his own thoughts\nHe\u2019s trapped\nWhen trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as\nGoing home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city\nThe result?\nWings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant\nFinally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations\nThat the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle\nAlthough the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different\nThey are one and the same\"\nWhat\u2019s your perspective on that?\nPac? Pac? Pac?!",
