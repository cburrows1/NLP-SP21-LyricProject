All I do is drop F-bombs\nFeel my wrath of attack\nRappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad\nIt's actually disastrously bad for the wack\nWhile I'm masterfully constructing this masterpi\u00e8ce\n\n'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?\nLet me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard\nEverybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like \u0399 have got\n\nWell, to be truthful the blueprint's\nSimply rage and youthful exuberance\nEverybody loves to root for a nuisance\nHit the Earth like an asteroid\nDid nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)\nMCs get taken to school with this music\n'Cause I use it as a vehicle to \"bus the rhyme\"\nNow I lead a new school full of students\nMe? I'm a product of Rakim\nLakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren\nYella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim\nInspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position\nTo meet Run\u2013D.M.C., induct them\nInto the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\nEven though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames\nOnly Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame\nOn the wall of shame\nYou fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames\nOff a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?\nLittle gay-lookin' boy\nSo gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)\nYou're witnessin' a mass-occur\nLike you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy\n\"Oy vey, that boy's gay!\"\u2014that's all they say, lookin' boy\nYou get a thumbs up, pat on the back\nAnd a \"way to go\" from your label every day, lookin' boy\nHey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?\nI get a \"hell yeah\" from Dre, lookin' boy\nI'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit\nGet outta my face, lookin' boy!\nBasically, boy, you're never gonna be capable\nOf keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause\u2014\n\nI'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nThe way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR\nDale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God\nKneel before General Zod\nThis planet's Krypton\u2014no, Asgard, Asgard\n\nSo you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin\nYou rodent, I'm omnipotent\nLet off, then I'm reloadin'\nImmediately with these bombs I'm totin'\nAnd I should not be woken\nI'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'\nBut I got your mom deep-throatin'\nI'm out my Ramen Noodle\nWe have nothin' in common, poodle\nI'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil\nIt's me, my honesty's brutal\nBut it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though\nFor good at least once in a while\nSo I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes\nTo maybe try to help get some people through tough times\nBut I gotta keep a few punchlines\nJust in case 'cause even you unsigned\nRappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime\nI know there was a time where once I\nWas king of the underground\nBut I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind\nSo I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine\nAppeal with the skin color of mine\nYou get too big and here they come tryin'\nTo censor you like that one line\nI said on \"I'm Back\" from The Mathers LP 1 when I\nTried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine\nPut 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9\nSee if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm\nMorphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal\nYou're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though\nAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for\nYou're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows\nYou write normal? Fuck being normal!\nAnd I just bought a new raygun from the future\nJust to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\n'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad\nSingin' to a man while he played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station\nThe very next day, \"Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!\"\nLyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)\nUh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and\nI'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\nNever fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating\n'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\n\"Oh, he's too mainstream.\"\nWell, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\n\"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,\"\u2014'cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on \"Lose Yourself\" and make 'em lose it\n\"I don't know how to make songs like that\nI don't know what words to use.\"\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you\nIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to\nProve that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!\nUgh, school flunky, pill junkie\nBut look at the accolades these skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I'm a million leagues above you\nIll when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you\nI'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel\nI'ma sleep in the front seat\nBumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\"\nBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils and here's what they want from me\nThey're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred\nI have, then you may be a little patient\nAnd more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!\nBut if I can't batter the women\nHow the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!\nDon't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake\nIf you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation\nTo trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and\nDon't be a retard\u2014be a king? Think not\nWhy be a king when you can be a god?",

He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\nMy name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)\nRiver (ooh), river run\nCall me (ooh), call me (ooh)\nRiver (ooh), we'll let the river run\n\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (I'm sorry)\nI don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run",

Is it the bar I set?\nMy arms, I stretch, but I can\u2019t reach\nA far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as\nSoon as I grab, squeeze\nI lose my grip like the flying trapeze\nInto the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening\nI know the mark\u2019s high, butter\u2013\nFlies rip apart my stomach\nKnowin' that no matter what bars I come with\nYou're gonna harp, gripe, and\nThat's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these\nAs pressure increases like khakis\nI feel the ice cracking, because\u2014\n\nI walk on water\nBut I ain't no Jesus\n(It's the curse of the\u2014, it's the curse of the\u2014)\nI walk on water (Shit)\nBut only when it freezes\n\nIt's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set\nAlways in search of the verse that I haven\u2019t spit yet\nWill this step just be another misstep\nTo tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect\nI\u2019ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless\nAnd it always feels like I'm hittin\u2019 the mark\n'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart\nLike, \"This shit is garbage!\"\nGod's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless\nKids look to me as a god, this is retarded\nIf only they knew, it's a facade and it\u2019s exhaustive\nAnd I try not to listen to nonsense\nBut if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence\nMission accomplished\nI'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith\nAnd I'm not Prince, so\u2026\n\nI walk on water\nBut I ain't no Jesus\nI walk on water\n(It's true, I'm a Rubik's\u2014, it's true\u2014)\nBut only when it freezes\n(It's true\u2014)\n\n'Cause I'm only human, just like you\nMaking my mistakes, oh if you only knew\nI don't think you should believe in me the way that you do\n'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh\n\nIt's true, I'm a Rubik's\u2014a beautiful mess\nAt times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest\nA flawed human, I guess\nBut I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex\u2013\nPectations and meet 'em, but first\nThe \"Speedom\" verse, now Big Sean\nHe's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?\nThere was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm\nEvery album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on\nAnd now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on\nBut the only one who's looking down on\nMe that matters now's DeShaun\nAm I lucky to be around this long?\nBegs the question though\nEspecially after the methadone\nAs yesterday fades and the Dresden home\nIs burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn\nThe crowds are gone\nAnd it's time to wash out the blonde\nSales decline, the curtain's drawn\nThey're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind\nAnd everyone who has doubt, remind\nNow take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times\nNow let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares\nOr gives a fuck about your rhymes\nAnd as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine\n'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight\nWhen I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?\nBut when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine\nI won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine\nBut I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause\u2014\n\nI walk on water\nBut I ain't no Jesus\nI walk on water\nBut only when it freezes\n\n'Cause I'm only human, just like you\nI've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew\nI don't think you should believe in me the way that you do\n'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh\nIf I walked on water, I would drown\n\n'Cause I'm just a man\nBut as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike\nSo me and you are not alike\nBitch, I wrote \"Stan\"",

There won't be no next time!\nI apologize, even though I know it's lies\nI'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar\nIf she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her\nTo the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna\u2014\n\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn?\nWell, that's all right because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry?\nWell, that's all right because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie",
