And did you know\nYour stairway lies on the whispering wind?\n\n\nAnd as we wind on down the road\nOur shadows taller than our soul\nThere walks a lady we all know\nWho shines white light and wants to show\nHow everything still turns to gold\nAnd if you listen very hard\nThe tune will come to you at last\nWhen all are one and one is all\nTo be a rock and not to roll\n\nAnd she's buying a stairway to Heaven",

Ahh!\nWe come from the land of the ice and snow\nFrom the midnight sun where the hot springs flow\n\nThe hammer of the gods\nWill drive our ships to new lands\nTo fight the horde, sing and cry\nValhalla, I am coming\n\nOn we sweep with threshing oar\nOur only goal will be the western shore\n\nAhh! Ahh!\nWe come from the land of the ice and snow\nFrom the midnight sun where the hot springs flow\n\nHow soft your fields so green\nCan whisper tales of gore\nOf how we calmed the tides of war\nWe are your overlords\n\nOn we sweep with threshing oar\nOur only goal will be the western shore\n\nSo now you'd better stop\nAnd rebuild all your ruins\nFor peace and trust can win the day\nDespite of all your losing",
