        "lyrics": "It was about four years ago\nWhen I first learned what it could mean for a heart to grow\nDo you remember the night you drove me home\nMy fingers tapping on your hand to the beat of the radio\nI remember the way it made me feel\nTo know I'm in the right place and this world was real\nIt was about three years ago\nWhen the summer ended and the fall began and I left you in the cold\nAnd on some other planed we survived the distance\nOn some other planet we lived without indifference\nAnd on some other planet the cold wind never came\nOn some other planet where things still feel the same\nYou were never one for ghosts or apparitions\nI'd ask what if there's more worlds out there\nYou never cared to listen\nNow its the only way to go back home\nFly through space and time back when\nThe clock hands move so slow\nAnd on some other planed we survived the distance\nOn some other planet we lived without indifference\nAnd on some other planet I hear you call my name\nOn some other planet where things still feel the same\nIt was about six months ago\nCrash landing through foreign sky find a place to call home",
