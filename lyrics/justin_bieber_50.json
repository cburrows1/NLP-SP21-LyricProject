Would you keep going?\nIf I told your family that you didn't mean nothing\nIf you posted about it and I didn't even comment\nIf the songs weren't true, but you still feel something\nWould you still come looking for me?\n\nOh, don't go reaching out\n'Cause you can't have everything\nYour head and your heart won't feel the same\nEven if it feels like it every time\n\nDon't check on me\nIf we're not together, then it's probably for a reason\nEvery heartbreak has its season\nIt ain't always summer in June\n\nMight run across your mind but don't worry 'bout me, no\nMy heart is back in one piece, it ain't skipped a beat, no\nFeeling rested up, I ain't missing sleep, no-oh\nDon't take it personal if I can't reply now\nI'm distant 'cause I don't wanna be reached now\nWon't let the ghosts of our past weigh my future down\nI'm liberated\nEnergy's like a circle, it comes back around\nReciprocated\nDon't shed no more tears\nWon't gain no empathy from me\nIn the upcoming years\nOh, I don't need your pity\nDon't check on me\n\nOh, don't check on me\nIf we're not together, then it's probably for a reason\nEvery heartbreak has its season\nAnd it looks like winter for you\n\nAin't call you back 'cause I let it go\nI had to focus energy and just let it flow\nAnd when we ride low, we were already gone\nIt wouldn't mean anymore to me now\nI know it hurts you so bad just to see me happy\nThat I finally moved on, and you thought it wouldn't happen\nAt times I used to cry when the world was laughing\nBut I act like I didn't notice\n\nOh, don't go reaching out\n'Cause you can't have everything\nYou can't kill a flame with gasoline\nEven if it feels like it every time\nNo matter how hard you try\n\nDon't check on me\nIf we're not together, then it's probably for a reason\nEvery heartbreak has its season\nIt ain't always summer in June\nDon't check on me\nIf we're not together, then it's probably for a reason\nEvery heartbreak has its season\nIt ain't always summer in June",
